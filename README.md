# Experimental Directorless W3C Process Document

This repository is an early version of an experimental fork of the [World Wide Web Consortium Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/),
made for the sake of exploring what the W3C process could look like without a director.

It can can be viewed at [https://frivoal.github.io/dirlessproc/](https://frivoal.github.io/dirlessproc/).

This is superseeded by [https://w3c.github.io/w3process/director-free/](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/director-free/)
