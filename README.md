# Experimental Directorless W3C Process Document

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frivoal/dirlessproc.svg?branch=dirless_master)](https://travis-ci.org/frivoal/dirlessproc)

This repository is an experimental fork of the [World Wide Web Consortium Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/),
made for the sake of exploring what the W3C process could look like without a director.

The editor's draft can be viewed at [https://frivoal.github.io/dirlessproc/](https://frivoal.github.io/dirlessproc/).
